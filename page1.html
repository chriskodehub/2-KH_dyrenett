                <div class="article-text">The <b>koala</b> or, inaccurately, koala bear (Phascolarctos cinereus), is an
                    arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the
                    family
                    Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are <b>the wombats</b>, which are members of the family
                    Vombatidae. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions,
                    inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by
                    its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The
                    <b>koala</b> has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Fur colour ranges from
                    silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and
                    lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate
                    subspecies, but this is disputed. </div>
